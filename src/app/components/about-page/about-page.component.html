  <h3>CATCH Overview</h3>

  <p>
    The Comet-Asteroid Telescopic Catalog Hub (CATCH) is a moving-target search
    tool for large astronomical data sets, such as time-domain or near-Earth
    object surveys. CATCH solves the needle in the haystack problem: comets and
    asteroids are the needles, and the archives of survey data are the
    haystacks.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Use CATCH to help identify pre-discovery detections, to examine past
      cometary activity, or to help you understand why a survey did not detect or
      report observations of an object.</em>
  </p>

  <p>Provide the name of an asteroid or comet, and for each indexed data set
    CATCH will:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Request an ephemeris for that object from
      NASA JPL's <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/">Horizons System</a>.</li>

    <li>Query the CATCH database for data near the ephemeris.</li>

    <li>Test each approximate match for detailed intersection.</li>

    <li>Return all positive matches with target and observational metadata.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Capabilities</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Results are presented in the browser, complete with image cutouts around
      the query target (when available).</li>

    <li>Backed by a publicly accessible API.</li>

    <li>Searches all near-Earth object survey data archived with NASA's
      Planetary Data System, and potentially any publicly hosted data archive
      could be included.</li>

    <li>Search results are cached and may be quickly retrieved thereafter, or
      refreshed with a new query.</li>

    <li>Queries may optionally search an area around the ephemeris: either an
      arbitrary radius, or using the ephemeris uncertainty ellipse (when
      available).</li>

    <li>Pixel-level precision is possible, depending on the metadata quality of
      the survey data or observation in question.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>CATCH Limitations and Caveats</h3>
  <p>
    CATCH does not perform detection-based searches. i.e., it cannot determine
    if an object was observed. Rather, it identifies images that
    <em>could</em>
    have observed a target, based on the target's ephemeris. This search also
    requires that the ephemeris correctly describes the target's motion on the
    sky, and that a potentially matching observation is correctly described by
    its metadata. Known issues are given below.
  </p>

  <h3>Known issues</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>NEAT astrometric solutions are typically 10s of arcsec off.</li>

    <li>Cutout services are not yet available for NEAT, Catalina Sky Survey, or
      Spacewatch.</li>

    <li>Target name resolution: our name resolution service is incomplete. Some real target
      names may not be resolved. However, CATCH can still attempt to search for
      them. Ultimately, any target must be resolvable by
      <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/">Horizons</a>. Use JPL's
      <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html">Small-Body Database Lookup</a>
      to test object names that are not working. Take care when searching for
      fragmented comets (e.g., 73P vs. 73P-C).
    </li>

    <li>Searches only include dates when an object is brighter than V=25 mag, as
      predicted by the ephemeris generator. Contact us if this limit is affecting
      your work.</li>
  </ol>
