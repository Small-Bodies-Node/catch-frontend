  <h3>CATCH Overview</h3>

  <p>
    The Comet-Asteroid Telescopic Catalog Hub (CATCH) is a moving-target search tool for large data
    sets, such as time-domain or near-Earth object surveys. You submit the name of an asteroid or
    comet, and CATCH will request an ephemeris for that object from
    <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons">NASA JPL's Horizons</a>
    tool, then compute whether the ephemeris intersects any images within its database of
    observations. If any matches are found, CATCH displays all the salient data to you. The
    telescopic surveys are the haystack, and the comet/asteroid is the needle that CATCH will help
    you find. Use CATCH to help identify pre-discovery detections, to examine past cometary
    activity, or to understand why a survey did not detect or report observations of an object.
  </p>

  <h3>
    CATCH Limitations and Caveats
  </h3>
  <p>
    CATCH does not perform detection-based searches. i.e., it cannot determine if an object was
    observed. Rather, it identifies images that
    <em>could</em>
    have observed a target, based on the target's ephemeris. This search requires that the ephemeris
    correctly describes the target's motion on the sky. CATCH properly considers the source data
    observatory when computing ephemerides. CATCH does not consider ephemeris uncertainties in the
    search, but this capability has been reserved for a future enhancement.

  <h3>Data sources</h3>

  <p>
    Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) survey data are from the NASA Planetary Data System archive
    of
    <a href="https://sbn.psi.edu/pds/resource/neat.html">Bauer and Lawrence</a>
    (2013):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      NEAT
      <abbr title="Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance">GEODSS</abbr>
      1m telescope at Haleakala Observatory, April 1996 &ndash; May 1998.
    </li>
    <li>
      NEAT Palomar (Tri-Cam), using the 1.2m Oschin Schmidt telscope at Palomar Observatory,
      November 2001 &ndash; March 2003.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <a href="http://skymapper.anu.edu.au/">SkyMapper Southern Survey</a>
    data are from the Austrailian National Observatory. The telescope is located at Siding Spring
    Observatory. Data release 2 covers the period March 2014 &ndash; March 2018.
  </p>

  <h3>Known issues</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>NEAT astrometic solutions are only approximate, and typically 10s of arcsec off.</li>
    <li>
      SkyMapper cutout service is not yet compatible with CATCH. Images may be downloaded with the
      cutout URLs provided for each search result.
    </li>
    <li>
      Target names: our name resolution service is incomplete. Some real target names may not be
      resolved. However, CATCH can still attempt to search for them. Ultimately, any target must be
      resolvable by
      <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons">Horizons</a>
      . Use JPL's
      <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi">Small-Body Database Browser</a>
      to test object names that are not working.
