# CatchFrontend

# Coding Conventions

- The term "api/Api" refers to the CATCH backend; any other api will be named more explicitly (e.g. 'nameResolutionApi')
- An 'apiResult' is whatever is returned from the Api; this might include 'apiData' as well as e.g. status codes
- An 'apiDatum' is an entry to an array of data ('apiData') embedded within a successful apiResult
